Final Project: #6

Project due date: May 1st, 2019 at 8 AM

Project description:A student is doing something under his desk and he's doing it to achieve a high excitement level. He must avoid being caught by the camera, the teacher and the acting vice principal who's also the football coach patrolling outside the classroom. The progress bar increases when he is doing it and decreases when he stops. Player will win this game when the bar is full and have some trouble if he is caught.

The Pizzazz feature that I added:
There is a moving spot light area that shows the sight of a camera.
I draw the sprites for player.(Actually my girlfriend drew them. So hardly I begged her.)
